# Challenge 4

In this challenge we are analyzing four different funds to determine which one we should add to a hypothetical invesment option list for a client. We calculate daily returns, standard deviations, the Sharpe ratio and the betas to make a conclusion of which one we should include.

Tools we used in this challenge are pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
